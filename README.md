# Renewind Model Tuning


Project completed as part of Great Learning's Program - Data Science and Business Analytics

**Repository includes  files:**

Jupyter notebook/ HTML generated from Jupyter with Python code written for data analysis and model building

**Problem Statement**
"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in wind energy production using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective is to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be brought down.
**Skills and Tools**

 - Exploratory Data Analysis  
  - Up and down sampling
  - Regularization
  - Hyperparameter tuning
